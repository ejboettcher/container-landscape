The purpose of this repository is to provide a technology landscape evaluation with the goal of determining which container technologies can potentially run on DoD HPC systems at scale to solve data analytics workflow problems and what hardware architectures are best to support them. This includes the following container technologies for consideration: Docker, Shifter, Singularity, LXC/LXD, and possibly others. The final list of container technologies will be determined in collaboration with the PETTT DSATA team. For each one investigated minimally list the security and system privilege requirements, describe the types of applications that can be addressed, and determine whether the technology can be deployed on current systems or requires some specialized architecture. Include other information to help differentiate the products and recommend which ones to investigate further.
