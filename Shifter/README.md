Shifter is a prototype implementation by NERSC at bringing containers to HPC systems.  It does this by converting docker images (and VMs and CHOS) to a common format that is scalably distributed across nodes.  Shifter allows the user to select a docker image (dockerfile) and submit a job that will run in that container.
