Singularity is an Apache Mesos framework. It runs as a task scheduler on top of Mesos Clusters taking advantage of Apache Mesos' scalability, fault-tolerance, and resource isolation. Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that simplifies the complexity of running different types of applications on a shared pool of servers. In Mesos terminology, Mesos applications that use the Mesos APIs to schedule tasks in a cluster are called frameworks.
